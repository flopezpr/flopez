    <h3>It's Only Up From Here!</h3>
    <p>Hi! This is my personal site, which marks my debut project. I'll be adding more projects as I keep 
      learning. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>About Me</h3> 
    <p style="font-size:2vw;">I was born in Manati, Puerto Rico and was raised in Yauco, Puerto Rico up until
    I was 9 and my dad moved us to Weatherford, Oklahoma. I briefly studied Psychology
    before realizing that I spent most of my free time learning about tech and switched
    gears to getting an A.A.S in Information Technology in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I'm now
    continuing to learn on my own and I'm loving every second of it. Some of my hobbies
    include playing the ukulele and piano, puzzles, traveling(especially camping), 
    learning, messing with all the new tech gadgets I get(solar right now!), and reading. </p>
