    <h3>Professional</h3>
    <p>I'm a young professional wanting to change careers. Currently I work as a courier
    for Fedex Express and a Looker for WeGoLook. I've been learning Ruby, HTML, CSS,
    GitHub, SQL, and WSL on my own for a few months now. I'm interested in software 
    engineering as well as some QA work. I'm studious, dedicated, a team player, and 
    ready to get my hands dirty with some real world projects.</p>
    
    <h3>Personal</h3> 
    <p>I was born in Manati, Puerto Rico and was raised in Yauco, Puerto Rico up until
    I was 9 and my dad moved us to Weatherford, Oklahoma. I briefly studied Psychology
    before realizing that I spent most of my free time learning about tech and switched
    gears to getting an A.A.S in Information Technology in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I'm now
    continuing to learn on my own and I'm loving every second of it. Some of my hobbies
    include playing the ukulele and piano, puzzles, traveling(especially camping), 
    learning, messing with all the new tech gadgets I get(solar right now!), and reading. </p>
