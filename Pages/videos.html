  <p class="text">This is one of my end of the year videos. I feel that it's easy to
    forget all of the good times we have every year so I wanted to capture
    as many as I could to be able to look back at them and smile. It's a great 
    feeling to see not just how I've grown but how my family and friends have
    grown as well.

  <p class="text">I go see my family in Puerto Rico as often as possible. I think it's important
    to remember where you came from so you can appreciate where you are in your
  journey. I'm forever grateful that I come from such a culturally rich island
full of creative and resilient people. </p>

  <div class="text">So, in 2022 I caught the camping fever. After watching hundreds(if not thousands)
    of overlanding, van life, and Japanese camping videos, I decided to take the leap
    and go on a roadtrip around the country. I borrowed my dad's SUV because my sedan
    just was not going to cut it and I filled it with my solar fridge, power station, 
    food, tablet, and my trusty rice cooker. I drove from Oklahoma to Arkansas, spent 
    a night in a beautiful forest in Tennessee, spend a night in a camper AirBnB
    in Atlanta where I went to my first solo concert, then headed back to Arkansas and
    spent two nights in a secluded forest in Fairfield Bay where I met one of the 
    coolest person. He was living off grid with his dog and it was just great hearing
    his stories. I would love to go back out and do this again.
